## Overview

The unicorn is a legendary creature depicted as a white horse with a single, large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead. Associated with purity, grace, and healing powers in medieval European tradition, the unicorn could allegedly only be captured by a virgin.

Historical descriptions likely arose from misidentified accounts of rhinoceros or oryx, combined with narwhal tusks sold as "unicorn horns" in medieval Europe. The unicorn became a powerful Christian symbol and appears prominently in heraldry, including as Scotland's national animal.

## Evidence & Historical Basis

### "Unicorn Horns" (Alicorns)

Medieval Europe possessed numerous alleged unicorn horns, sold for astronomical prices and used medicinally. All examined specimens are narwhal tusks.

**Status**: Debunked — All identified as narwhal tusks through chemical analysis.

### Ancient Descriptions

Greek and Roman natural histories describe one-horned creatures in India and Ethiopia.

**Analysis**: Likely based on:
- **Rhinoceros**: Ctesias' description matches Indian rhinoceros
- **Oryx**: Arabian oryx viewed from side appears single-horned
- **Multiple animals conflated**: Combined features from various species

---

## Theories & Explanations

### Historical Basis Theories

1. **Rhinoceros Misidentification**
   Travelers' accounts of Indian rhinoceros distorted through retelling across cultures and time.

2. **Oryx Conflation**
   Arabian oryx viewed in profile appears to have a single horn when both horns align.

3. **Narwhal Tusk Trade**
   Viking trade of narwhal tusks to medieval Europe reinforced and perpetuated unicorn belief.

4. **Symbolic Creature**
   Purely allegorical creation for Christian and medieval symbolism without zoological basis.
