      "full": "The unicorn is a legendary creature depicted as a white horse with a single, large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead. Associated with purity, grace, and healing powers in medieval European tradition, the unicorn could allegedly only be captured by a virgin. Historical descriptions likely arose from misidentified accounts of rhinoceros or oryx, combined with narwhal tusks sold as 'unicorn horns' in medieval Europe. The unicorn became a powerful Christian symbol and appears prominently in heraldry, including as Scotland's national animal."
